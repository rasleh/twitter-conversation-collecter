HOW TO RUN IT
-------------

Once you have the ID of the tweet that you want to get the conversation for, you execute the retrieve_conversation_thread command of the get.thread.py file, using the parameters ('user id', 'tweet id')

Files are UTF-16 encoded, and data is saved in the format:
dd-mm-yy.json
dd being the date of the data load, mm the month and yy the year.
